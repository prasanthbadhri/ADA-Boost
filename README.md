# ADA-Boost

Boosting algorithms work on the idea of first building a model on the training dataset and then building a second model to correct the faults in the first model. This technique is repeated until the mistakes are reduced and the dataset is accurately predicted. Boosting algorithms function similarly in that they combine numerous models (weak learners) to produce the final result (strong learners).

There are **three** kinds of boosting algorithms:
  1. The AdaBoost algorithm is used.
  2. Gradient descent algorithm
  3. Xtreme gradient descent algorithm

There are several machine learning algorithms from which to chose for your issue statements. AdaBoost in machine learning is one of these predictive modelling techniques. AdaBoost, also known as Adaptive Boosting, is a Machine Learning approach that is utilised as an Ensemble Method. AdaBoost's most commonly used estimator is decision trees with one level, which is decision trees with just one split. These trees are often referred to as Decision Stumps.

This approach constructs a model and assigns equal weights to all data points. It then applies larger weights to incorrectly categorised points. All points with greater weights are given more weight. It will continue to train models until a smaller error is returned.
